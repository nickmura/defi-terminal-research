# Fork + PR Plugin Model

## How It Works

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. Fork Repository
   ├── Clone official repo
   ├── Add custom plugins locally  
   └── Build for personal use

2. Local Development
   ├── Experiment freely
   ├── No approval needed
   └── Full control over features

3. Contribute Back (Optional)
   ├── Submit PR for useful plugins
   ├── Core team review process
   └── Merge into official distribution
```

## Architecture Benefits

### For Developers
```
✅ Unlimited Experimentation
- Fork and modify anything
- No permission barriers
- Rapid prototyping possible

✅ Simple Architecture  
- No complex plugin API
- Just add code to repo
- Standard development workflow

✅ Full Feature Access
- Can modify core if needed
- No sandboxing limitations
- Direct integration possible
```

### For Core Team
```
✅ Quality Control
- Review all contributions
- Maintain code standards
- Reject poor/dangerous code

✅ Security Gateway
- Manual code review
- No runtime plugin risks
- Trusted code only

✅ Cohesive Vision
- Curate feature set
- Avoid feature bloat
- Maintain UX consistency
```

### For End Users
```
✅ Stable Experience
- Only vetted plugins included
- No plugin compatibility issues
- Single, tested distribution

✅ Professional Tool
- Cohesive feature set
- Consistent documentation
- Reliable updates
```

## Real-World Examples

### VS Code Approach
```
Core Extensions:
- Shipped with VS Code
- Microsoft maintained
- High quality bar

Community Extensions:
- Separate marketplace
- Variable quality
- User installs individually

Your Model is Like:
- Core extensions only
- But community can fork/PR
```

### Kubernetes Model  
```
Core Features:
- Included in main distribution
- Kubernetes team maintains
- Strict acceptance criteria

External Projects:
- Start as separate repos
- Prove value over time
- Graduate to core if successful
```

## Contribution Flow

### 1. Developer Journey
```
"I want to add Solana support"

Step 1: Fork Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourname/defi-terminal
cd defi-terminal

Step 2: Add Plugin Locally
mkdir plugins/community/solana
# Develop solana plugin

Step 3: Test Locally  
npm run build
./terminal swap SOL USDC  # Works locally!

Step 4: Contribute Back
git push origin feature/solana-support
# Open PR with plugin
```

### 2. Review Process
```
PR Submitted
    ├── Automated Tests
    ├── Code Review
    ├── Security Audit
    └── Feature Discussion
         ├── Accept → Merge to official/
         ├── Request Changes
         └── Reject (with feedback)
```

## Plugin Categories

### Official Plugins (High Bar)
```
Criteria:
- Widely useful feature
- High code quality
- Well documented
- Maintained long-term
- Fits terminal vision

Examples:
- Core trading operations
- Standard analytics
- Basic portfolio management
```

### Community Plugins (Lower Bar)
```  
Criteria:
- Code quality acceptable
- No security issues
- Documented for users
- Niche but valuable

Examples:
- Protocol-specific tools
- Advanced analytics
- Experimental features
```

### Experimental (Very Low Bar)
```
Criteria:
- Doesn't break anything
- Interesting proof-of-concept
- Learning/demo purpose

Examples:
- New protocol integrations
- UI experiments
- Performance optimizations
```

## Governance Questions

### What gets accepted into official/?
- Core team decision
- Community voting
- Usage-based promotion
- Objective criteria

### How do you handle conflicts?
- Multiple similar plugins
- Competing implementations
- Feature overlap

### Who maintains contributed code?
- Original contributor
- Core team adoption
- Community maintenance

## Advantages Over Complex Plugin Systems

### No Plugin API to Maintain
```
Traditional Plugin System:
- Define plugin interfaces
- Maintain API compatibility  
- Handle version conflicts
- Complex lifecycle management

Your Approach:
- Plugins are just code
- Standard build process
- No compatibility matrix
- Simple integration
```

### No Runtime Plugin Management
```  
Traditional System:
- Plugin loading/unloading
- Dependency resolution
- Resource isolation
- Error recovery

Your Approach:
- Everything compiled together
- No runtime complexity
- Single binary distribution
- Standard error handling
```

## Potential Challenges

### Scale Issues
```
Problem: Too many PR requests
Solution: Clear contribution guidelines

Problem: Core team bottleneck  
Solution: Community maintainers

Problem: Code base bloat
Solution: Plugin organization/cleanup
```

### Quality Control
```
Problem: Inconsistent plugin quality
Solution: Review checklist/automated tests

Problem: Maintenance burden
Solution: Require maintainer commitment

Problem: Breaking changes
Solution: Deprecation process
```

This model is actually used by many successful projects - it gives you the innovation of open source with the quality control of curated software.
